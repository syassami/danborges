words = "the universe, which others call the library, is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries. in the center of each gallery is a ventilation shaft, bounded by a low railing. from any hexagon one can see the floors above and below, one after another, endlessly. the arrangement of the galleries is always the same, twenty bookshelves, five to each side, line four of the hexagons six sides, the height of the bookshelves, floor to ceiling, is hardly greater than the height of a normal librarian. one of the hexagons free sides opens on to a narrow sort of vestibule, which in turn opens onto another gallery, identical to the first, identical in fact to all. to the left and right of the vestibule there are two tiny compartments. one is for sleeping, upright, the other, for satisfying ones physical necessities. through this space, too, there passes a spiral staircase, which winds upward and downward in the remotest distances. in the vestibule there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates appearances. men often infer from this mirror that the library is not infinite, if it were, what need would there be for that illusory replication? i prefer to dream that burnished surfaces are a figuration and promise of the infinite... light is provided by certain spherical fruits that bear the name of bulbs. there are two of these bulbs in each hexagon, set crosswise. the light they give is insufficient, and unceasing.  like all men of the library, in my younger days i traveled, i have journeyed in quest of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues. now that my eyes can hardly make out what i myself have written, i am preparing to die, a few leagues from the hexagon where i was born. when i am dead, compassionate hands will throw me over the railing, my tomb will be the unfathomable air, my body will sink for ages, and will decay and dissolve in the wind engendered by my fall, which shall be infinite. i declare that the library is endless. idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are the necessary shape of absolute space or, at least, of our perception of space. they argue that a triangular or pentagonal chamber is inconceivable.  the mystics claim that their ecstasies reveal to them a circular chamber containing an enormous circular book with a continuous spine that goes completely around the walls. but their testimony is suspect, their words obscure. that cyclical book is god. let it suffice for the moment that i repeat the classic dictum, the library is a sphere whose exact center is any hexagon and whose circumference is unattainable.  each wall of each hexagon is furnished with five bookshelves, each bookshelf holds thirtyfive books identical in format, each book contains four hundred ten pages, each page, forty lines, each line, approximately eighty black letters. there are also letters on the front cover of each book, those letters neither indicate nor prefigure what the pages inside will say. i am aware that the lack of correspondence once struck men as mysterious. before summarizing the solution of the mystery, whose discovery, in spite of its tragic consequences, is perhaps the most important event in all history, i wish to recall a few axioms.  first, the library has existed ab aeternitate. that truth, whose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the world, no rational mind can doubt. man, the imperfect librarian, may be the work of chance or of malevolent demiurges, the universe, with its elegant appointments, its bookshelves, its enigmatic books, its indefatigable staircases for the traveler and its water closets for the seated librarian, can only be the handiwork of a god. in order to grasp the distance that separates the human and the divine, one has only to compare these crude trembling symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book with the organic letters inside, neat, delicate, deep black, and inimitably symmetrical.  second, the orthographical symbols are twentyfive in number. that discover enabled mankind, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the library and thereby satisfactorily solve the riddle that no conjecture had been able to divine, the formless and chaotic nature of virtually all books. one book, which my father once saw in a hexagon in circuit fifteen ninetyfour, consisted of the letters mcv perversely repeated from the first line to the last. another, much consulted in this zone, is a mere labyrinth of letters whose penultimate page contains the phrase oh time thy pyramids. this much is known, for every rational line or forthright statement there are leagues of senseless cacophony, verbal nonsense and incoherency. i know of one semi barbarous zone whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious habit of trying to find sense in books, equating such a quest with attempting to find meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of the palm of ones hand... they will acknowledge that the inventors of writing imitated the twentyfive natural symbols, but contend that that adoption was fortuitous, coincidental, and that the books in themselves have no meaning. that argument, as we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.  for many years it was believed that those impenetrable books were in ancient or far distant languages. it is true that the most ancient peoples, the first librarians, employed a language quite different from the one we speak today, it is true that a few miles to the right, our language devolves into dialect and that ninety floors above, it becomes incomprehensible. all of that, i repeat, is true, but four hundred ten pages of unvarying mcvs cannot belong to any language, however dialectical or primitive it may be. some have suggested that each letter influences the next, and that the value of mcv on page seventyone, line three is not the value of the same series on another line of another page, but that vague thesis has not met with any great acceptance. others have mentioned the possibility of codes, that conjecture has been universally accepted, though not in the sense in which its originators formulated it.  some five hundred years ago, the chief of the upper hexagons came across a book as jumbled as all the others, but containing almost two pages of homogeneous lines. he showed his find to a traveling decipherer, who told him that the lines were written in portuguese, others said they were yiddish. within the century experts had determined what the language actually was, a samoyed.lithuanian dialect of guarani, with inflections from classical arabic. the content was also determined, the rudiments of combinatory analysis, illustrated with examples of endlessly repeating variations. those examples allowed a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the library. this philosophical observed that all books, however different from one another they might be, consist of identical elements, the space, the period, the comma, the twentytwo letters of the alphabet. he also posited a fact which travelers have confirmed, in the vast library there are no two identical books. from those incontrovertible premises, the deduced that the library is total, perfect, complete, and whole, and that its bookshelves contain all possible combinations of the twentytwo orthographic symbols, a number which, though unimaginably vast, is not infinite, that is, all that is able to be expressed, in every language. all. the detailed history of the future, the autobiographies of the archangels, the faithful catalog of the library, thousands and thousands of false catalogs, the proof of the falsity of the true catalogue, the gnostic gospel of basilides, the commentary upon that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book into every language, the interpolation of every book into all books, the treatise bede could have written, but did not, on the mythology of the saxon people, the lost books of tacitus.  when it was announced that the library contained all books, the first reaction was one of unbounded joy. all men felt themselves to be possessors of an intact and secret treasure. there was no personal, no world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist somewhere in some hexagon. the universe was justified, the universe suddenly became congruent with the unlimited width and breadth of humankinds hope. at that period there was much talk of the vindications, books of apology and prophecies that would vindicate for all time the actions of every person in the universe and that held wondrous arcana for mens futures. thousands of the greedy individuals abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed downstairs, upstairs, spurred by the vain to find their vindication. these pilgrims squalled in the narrow corridors, muttered dark imprecations, strangled one other on the divine staircases, threw deceiving volumes down ventilation shafts, were themselves hurled to their deaths by men of distant regions. others went insane... the vindications do exist. i have seen two of them, which refer to persons in the future, persons perhaps not imaginary, but those who went in quest of them failed to recall that the chance of a mans finding his own vindication, or some perfidious version of his own, can be calculated as zero.  at that same period there was also hope that the mysteries of mankind the origin of the library and of time might be reveled. it all likelihood those profound mysteries can indeed be explained in words, if the language of the philosophers is not sufficient, then the multiform library must surely have produced the extraordinary language that is required, together with the words and grammar of that language. for four centuries men have been scouring the hexagons... there are official searchers, the inquisitors. i have seen about their tasks, they arrive exhausted at some hexagon, they talk about a staircase that nearly killed them, some steps were missing, they speak with the librarian about galleries and staircases, and, once in a while, they take up the nearest book and leaf through it, searching for disgraceful or dishonorable words. clearly, no one expects to discover anything.  that unbridled hopefulness was succeeded, naturally enough by a similarly disproportionate depression. the certainty that some bookshelf in some hexagon contained precious books, yet that those precious books were forever out of reach, was almost unbearable. one blasphemous sect proposed that the searches be discontinued and that all men shuffle letters and symbols until those canonical books, through some improbable stroke of chance, had been constructed. the authorities were forced to issue strict orders. the sect disappeared, but in my childhood i have seen old men who, for long periods would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine disorder.  others, going about it in the opposite way, thought the first thing to do was eliminate all worthless books. they would invade the hexagons, show credentials that were not always false, leaf disgustedly through a volume, and condemn entire walls of books. it is to their hygienic, ascetic rage that we lay in the senseless loss of millions of volumes. their name is execrated today, but those who grieve over the treasures destroyed in that frenzy overlook two widely acknowledged facts, one, that the library is so huge that any reduction by human hands must be infinitesimal. and two, that each book is unique and irreplaceable, but, since the library is total, there are always several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles, books that differ by no more than a single letter, or a comma. despite general opinion, i daresay that the consequences of the depredations committed by the purifiers have been exaggerated by the horror those same fanatics inspired. they were spurred on by the holy zeal to reach, someday, through unrelenting effort, the books of the crimson hexagon, books smaller than natural books, allpowerful, illustrated and magical.  we also have knowledge of another superstition from that period, belief in what was termed the bookman. on some shelf in some hexagon, it was argued, there must exist a book which is the cipher and perfect compendium of all other books, and some librarian must have examined that book, this librarian is analogous to a god. in the language of this zone there are still vestiges of the sect that worshiped that distant librarian. many have gone in search of him. for a hundred years men beat every possible path, and every path in vain. how was one to locate the idolized secret hexagon that sheltered him someone supposed searching by progression, to locate book a, first consult book b which tells where book a can be found, to locate book b, first consult book c, and so on to infinity...  in is in ventures such as these that i have squandered and spent my years. it cannot think it unlikely that there is such a total book on some shelf in the universe. i pray to the unknown gods that some man, even a single man, tens of centuries ago has perused and read that book. if the honor and wisdom and joy of such a reading are not to be my own me, then let them be for others. let heaven exist, though my own place be in hell. let me be tortured and battered and annihilated, but let their be one instant, one creature, wherein thy enormous library may find its justification.  infidels claim that the rule in the library is not sense, but nonsense, and that rationality, even humble, pure coherence is an almost miraculous exception. they speak, i know, of the feverish library, whose random volumes constantly threaten to transmogrify into others, so that they affirm all things, deny all things, and confound and confuse all things, like some mad and hallucinating deity. those words, which not only proclaim disorder but exemplify it as well, prove, as we all can see, the infidels deplorable taste and desperate ignorance. for while the library contains all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the twentyfive orthographic symbols, it includes not a single absolute piece of nonsense. it would be pointless to observe that the finest volume of all the many hexagons that i myself administer is entitled combed thunderclap, while another title is the plaster cramp and another axaxaxas. those phrases, at first apparently incoherent, are undoubtedly susceptible to cryptographic or allegorical reading, that reading, that justification of the words order and existence, is itself verbal and, ex hypothesi, already contained somewhere in the library. there is no combination of characters one can make, dhcmrlchtdj, for example, that the divine library has not foreseen and that in one or more of its secret tongues does not hide a terrible significance. there is no syllable one can speak that is not filled with tenderness and terror, that is not, in one of those languages, the might name of a god. to speak is to commit tautologies. this pointless, verbose epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves in one of the countless hexagons, as does its refutation.  a number n of possible languages employ the same vocabulary, in some of them, the symbol library possess the correct definition everlasting ubiquitous system of hexagonal galleries, while library, the thing, is a loaf of break or a pyramid or something else, and the six words that define it themselves have other definitions. you who read me, are you certain you understand my language.  methodical composition distracts me from the present condition of humanity. the certainty that everything has already been written annuls us, or renders us phantasmal. i know districts in which the young people prostrate themselves before books and like savages kiss their pages, though they cannot read a letter. epidemics, heretical discords, pilgrimages that inevitably degenerate into brigandage have decimated the population. i believe i mentioned the suicides, which are more and more frequent every year. i am perhaps misled by old age and fear, but i suspect that the human species. the only species, teeters at the verge of extinction, yet that the library, enlightened, solitary, infinite, perfectly unmoving, armed with precious volumes, pointless, incorruptible, and secret, will endure.  i have just written the word infinite. i have not included that adjective out of mere rhetorical habit, i hereby state that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite. those who believe it to have limits hypothesize that in some remote place or places the corridors and staircases and hexagons may, inconceivably, end, which is absurd. and yet those who picture the world to be unlimited forget that the number of possible books is not. i will be bold enough to suggest this solution to the ancient problem, the library is unlimited but periodic. if an eternal traveler should journey in any direction, he would find after untold centuries that the same volumes are repeated in the same disorder, which, repeated in the same disorder, which, repeated, becomes order, the order. my solitude is cheered by this elegant hope.  the universe, which others call the library, is composed of an indefinite, perhaps an infinite, number of hexagonal galleries, with enormous ventilation shafts in the middle, encircled by very low railings. from any hexagon the upper and lower stories are visible, interminably. the distribution of the galleries is invariable. twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two, their height, which is that of each floor, scarcely exceeds that of an average librarian. one of the free sides gives upon a narrow entrance way, which leads to another gallery, identical to the first to all the others. to the left and to the right of the entrance way are two miniature rooms. one allows standing room for sleeping, the other, the satisfaction of fecal necessities. through this section passes the spiral staircase, which plunges down into the abyss and rises up to the heights.  in the entrance way hangs a mirror, which faithfully duplicates appearances. people are in the habit of inferring from this mirror that the library is not infinite. if it were, why this illusory duplication. i prefer to dream that the polished surfaces feign and promise the infinity...  light comes from some spherical fruits called by the name of lamps. there are two, running transversally, in each hexagon. the light they emit is insufficient, incessant.  like all men of the library, i have traveled in my youth. i have journeyed in search of a book, perhaps of the catalogue of catalogues, now that my eyes can scarcely decipher what i write, i am preparing to die a few leagues from the hexagon in which i was born. once dead, there will not lack of pious hands to hurl me over the banister, my sepulchre shall be the unfathomable air, my body will sink lengthily and will corrupt and dissolve in the wind engendered by the fall, which is infinite. i affirm that the library is interminable. the idealists argue that the hexagonal halls are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. they contend that a triangular or pentagonal hall is inconceivable. the mystics claim that to them ecstasy reveals a round chamber containing a great book, with a continuous back circling the walls of the room, but their testimony is suspect, their words, obscure. that cyclical book is god. let it suffice me, for the time being, to repeat the classic dictum, the library is a sphere whose consummate center is any hexagon, and whose circumference is inaccessible.  five shelves correspond to each one of walls of each hexagon, each shelf contains thirtytwo books of a uniform format, each book is made up of four hundred and ten pages, each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty black letters. there are also letters on the spine of each book, these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say. i know that such a lack of relevance, at one time, seemed mysterious. before summarizing the solution, whose disclosure, despite its tragic implications, is perhaps the capital fact of this history, i want to recall a few axioms.  the first, the library exists ab aeterno. no reasonable mind can doubt this truth, whose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the world. man, the imperfect librarian, may be the work of chance or of malevolent demiurges, the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatic volumes, of indefatigable ladders for the voyager and of privies for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a god. in order to perceive the distance which exists between the divine and the human, it is enough to compare the rude tremulous symbols which my fallible hand scribbles on the end pages of a book, with the organic letters inside, exact, delicate, intensely black, inimitably symmetric.  the second, the number of orthographic symbols is twentyfive. this bit of evidence permitted the formulation, three hundred years ago, of a general theory of the library and the satisfactory resolution of the problem which no conjecture has yet made clear, the formless and chaotic nature of almost all books. one of these books, which my father saw in a hexagon of the circuit number fifteen ninetyfour, was composed of the letters mcv perversely repeated from first line to last. another, very much consulted in this zone, is a mere labyrinth of letters, but on the next to last page, one may read o time your pyramids. as is well known, for one reasonable line or straightforward note, there are leagues of insensate cacophony, of verbal farragoes and incoherencies. i know of a wild region whose librarians repudiate the vain superstitious custom of seeking any sense in books and compare it to looking for meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of ones hands... they admit that the inventors of writing imitated the twentyfive natural symbols, but they maintain that this application is accidental and that books in themselves mean nothing. this opinion, we shall see, is not altogether false.  for a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books belonged to past or remote languages. it is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, made use of a language quite different from the one we speak today, it is true that some miles to the right the language is dialectical and that ninety stories up it is incomprehensible. all this, i repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of unvarying mcvs do not correspond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it might be. some librarians insinuated that each letter could influence the next, and that the value of mcv on the third line of page seventy one was not same as that of the same series in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prosper. still other men thought in terms of cryptographs, this conjecture has come to be universally accepted, though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its inventors.  five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon came upon a book as confusing as all the rest but which contained nearly two pages of homogeneous lines. he showed his finding to an ambulant decipherer, who told him the lines were written in portuguese. others told him they were in yiddish. in less than a century the nature of the language was finally established, it was a samoyed.lithuanian dialect of guarani, with classical arabic inflections. the contents were also deciphered, notions of combinational analysis, illustrated by examples of variations with unlimited repetition. these examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the library. this thinker observed that all the books, however diverse, are made up of uniform elements, the period, the comma, the space, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. he also adduced a circumstance confirmed by all travelers, there are not, in the whole vast library, two identical books. from all these incontrovertible premises he deduced that the library is total and that its shelves contain all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols whose number, though vast, is not infinite, that is, everything that can be expressed, in all languages. everything is there, the minute history of the future, the autobiographies of the archangels, the faithful catalogue of the library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, a demonstration of the fallacy of these catalogues, a demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the gnostic gospel of basilides, the commentary on this gospel, the commentary on the commentary of this gospel, the veridical account of your death, a version of each book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.  when it was proclaimed that the library comprised all books, the first impression was one of extravagant joy. all men felt themselves lords of a secret, intact treasure. there was no personal or universal problem whose eloquent solution did not exist, in some hexagon. the universe was justified, the universe suddenly expanded to the limitless dimensions of hope. at that time there was much talk of the vindications, books of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the actions of every man in the world and established a store of prodigious arcana for the future. thousands of the covetous persons abandoned their dear natal hexagons and crowded up the stairways, urged on by the vain aim of finding their vindication. these pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors, hurled dark maledictions, strangled each other on the divine stairways, flung the deceitful books to the bottom of the tunnels, and died as they were thrown into space by men from remote regions. some went mad....  the vindications do exist. i have myself seen two of these books, which were concerned with future people, people who were perhaps not imaginary. but the searchers did not remember that the calculable possibility of a mans finding his own book, or some perfidious variation of his own book, is close to zero.  the clarification of the basic mysteries of humanity, the origin of the library and of time, was also expected. it is credible that those grave mysteries can be explained in words, if the language of philosophers does not suffice, the multiform library will have produced the unexpected language required, and the necessary vocabularies and grammars for this language.  it is now four centuries since men have been wearying the hexagons....  there are official searchers, inquisitors. i have observed them carrying out their functions, they are always exhausted. they speak of a staircase without steps where they were almost killed. they speak of galleries and stairs with the local librarian. from time to time they will pick up the nearest book and leaf through its pages, in search of infamous words. obviously, no one expects to discover anything.  the uncommon hope was followed, naturally enough, by deep depression. the certainty that some shelf in some hexagon contained precious books and that these books were inaccessible seemed almost intolerable. a blasphemous sect suggested that all searches be given up and that men everywhere shuffle letters and symbols until they  succeeded in composing, by means of an improbable stroke of luck, the canonical books. the authorities found themselves obliged to issue severe orders. the sect disappeared, but in my childhood i still saw old men who would hide out in the privies for long periods of time, and, with metal disks in a forbidden dicebox, feebly mimic the divine disorder.  others, inversely, thought that the primary task was to eliminate useless works. they would invade the hexagons, exhibiting credentials which were not always false, skim through a volume with annoyance, and then condemn entire bookshelves to destruction, their ascetic, hygienic fury is responsible for the senseless loss of millions of books. their name is execrated, but those who mourn the treasures destroyed by this frenzy overlook two notorious facts. one, the library is so enormous that any reduction undertaken by humans is infinitesimal. two, each book is unique, irreplaceable, but, inasmuch as the library is total, there are always several hundreds of thousands of imperfect facsimiles of works which differ only by one letter or one comma. contrary to public opinion, i dare suppose that the consequences of the depredations committed by the purifiers have been exaggerated by the horror which these fanatics provoked. they were spurred by the delirium of storming the books in the crimson hexagon, books of a smaller than ordinary format, omnipotent, illustrated, magical.  we know too, of another superstition of that time, the man of the book. in some shelf of some hexagon, men reasoned, there must exist a book which is the cipher and perfect compendium of all the rest, some librarian has perused it, and it is analogous to a god. vestiges of the worship of that remote functionary still persist in the language of this zone. many pilgrimages have sought him out. for a century they trod the most diverse routes in vain. how to locate the secret hexagon which harbored it someone proposed a regressive approach, in order to locate book a, first consult book b which will indicate the location of a, in order to locate book b, first consult book c, and so on ad infinitum...  i have squandered and consumed my years in adventures of this type. to me, it does not seem unlikely that on some shelf of the universe there lies a total book. i pray the unknown gods that some man, even if only one man, and though it have been thousands of years ago, may have examined and read it. if honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. may heaven exist, though my place be in hell. let me be outraged and annihilated, but may thy enormous library be justified, for one instant, in one being.  the impious assert that absurdities are the norm in the library and that anything reasonable, even humble and pure coherence, is an almost miraculous exception. they speak, i know, of the febrile library whose hazardous volumes run the constant risk of being changed into others and in which everything is affirmed, denied and confused as by a divinity in delirium. these words, which not only denounce disorder but exemplify it as well, manifestly demonstrate the bad taste of the speakers and their desperate ignorance. actually, the library includes all verbal structures, all the variations allowed by the twentyfive orthographic symbols, but it does not permit of one absolute absurdity. it is pointless to observe that the best book in the numerous hexagons under my administration is entitled combed clap of thunder, or that another is called the plaster cramp and still another axaxaxas ml. such propositions as are contained in these titles, at first sight incoherent, doubtless yield a cryptographic or allegorical justification.  since they are verbal, these justifications already figure, ex hypothesi, in the library. i can not combine certain as, dhcmrlchtdj, which the divine library has not already foreseen in combination, and which in one of its secret languages does not encompass some terrible meaning. no one can articulate a syllable which is not full of tenderness and fear, and which is not, in one of those languages, the powerful name of some god. to speak is to fall into tautologies. this useless and wordy epistle itself already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves in one of uncountable hexagons, and so does its refutation. an n number of possible languages makes use of the same vocabulary, in some of them, the symbol library admits of the correct definition ubiquitous and everlasting system of hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and the seven words which define it possess another value. you who read me, are you sure you understand my language.  methodical writing distracts me from the present condition of men. but the certainty that everything has been already written nullifies or makes phantoms of us all. i know of districts where the youth prostrate themselves before books and barbarously kiss the pages, though they do not know how to make out a single letter. epidemics, heretical disagreements, the pilgrimages which inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the population. i believe i have mentioned the suicides, more frequent each year. perhaps i am deceived by old age and fear, but i suspect that the human species, the unique human species, is on the road to extinction, while the library will last on forever, illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly immovable, filled with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.  infinite i have just written. i have not interpolated this adjective merely from rhetorical habit. it is not illogical, i say, to think that the world is infinite. those who judge it to be limited, postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairs and hexagons could inconceivably cease, a manifest absurdity. those who imagined it to be limitless forget that the possible number of books is limited. i dare insinuate the following solution to this ancient problem, the library is limitless and periodic. if an eternal voyager were to traverse it in any direction, he would find, after many centuries, that the same volumes are repeated in the same disorder, which, repeated, would constitute an order, order itself. my solitude rejoices in this elegant hope."
