    *The above line is composed of words from Jorge Luis Borges’ “The Library of Babel” [“La Biblioteca de Babel”]; its format was inspired by the unexplained discrepancies between the 1941 and 1944 versions of the text.
   </p> 
   <br />
   <p>
    Borges (or his editors) made significant changes to the short story between 1941 and 1944. One of the most provocative changes occurs in the section describing the possible contents of this “infinite” library. The version published in El Jardin de los Senderos Que se Bifurcan (1941) and translated by Andrew Hurley in 1998 includes the following description:
  </p>
     <br />
   <p style="padding-left:3em">
    … [The library’s] bookshelves contain all the possible combinations of the twenty-two orthographic symbols … all that is able to be expressed, in every language. All — the detailed history of the future … the true story of your death, the translation of every book into every language, the interpolations of every book into all books, the treatise Bede could have written (but did not) on the mythology of the Saxon people, the lost books of Tacitus.
   </p> 
      <br />
   <p style="padding-left:3em">
    … sus anaqueles registran todas las posibles combinaciones de los veintitantos símbolos ortográficos … o sea todo lo que es dable expresar: en todos los idiomas. Todo: la historia minuciosa del porvenir, … la relación verídica de tu muerte, la versión de cada libro a todas las lenguas, las interpolaciones de cada libro en todos los libros, el tratado que Beda pudo escribir (y no escribió) sobre la mitología de los sajones, los libros perdidos de Tácito.
   </p>
      <br />
   <p>
    In 1944, “La Biblioteca de Babel” was grouped with nine “Artificios” and published by Editorial Sur as Ficciones. In Ficciones the concluding phrases concerning Bede and Tacitus have been omitted. In Anthony Kerrigan’s translation of Ficciones published in 1962, the sentence in question reads: 
  </p>
     <br />
   <p style="padding-left:3em">
  Everything is there: the minute history of the future, … the veridical account of your death, a version of each book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.
  </p>
     <br />
   <p style="padding-left:3em">
Todo: la historia minuciosa del porvenir, … la relación verídica de tu muerte, la versión de cada libro a todas las lenguas, las interpolaciones de cada libro en todos los libros.
     <br />
  <p>
   It makes sense that Borges would condense the line. After explaining that the library contains “everything...a version of each book in all languages” the phrases about books Bede could have written (but did not) and Tacitus’ lost books are unnecessary, even tautological. If the library is total, all books are books that Bede could have written (but did not), and no book could be one of the “lost” books of Tacitus if no specific book can found. Like superfluous lines of code, the passage loses no meaning and becomes more graceful after the phrases are erased.
 </p>
    <br />
  <p>
   However, changing words and phrases in one of the most famous short stories of the twentieth century (or a computer program) reflects the enigma of a Library (and the Internet) in which changing even one letter justifies a completely new book, a book that might be stored in a shelf that is light-years from the “original.” In addition, Borges, a multilingual scholar and translator, implied that “faithful” translations might have less to do with faith or knowledge and more to do with luck, evocatively asking: 
 </p>
    <br />
   <p style="padding-left:3em">
  “Is translation more than the long experimental lottery of omissions and emphases?”
 </p>
    <br />
 <p>
  Therefore, the “long experimental lottery” of this infinitive translation (a play on the desire for definitive translations) uses a machine that randomly selects a word from one of the two editions published by Borges (in 1941 and 1944) and one of the two translations (by Hurley and Kerrigan) and then applies 2-gram modelling from the Python Natural Language Tool Kit to generate a somewhat meaningful line of sixteen words or approximately 80 characters (like the lines in every book in the Library of Babel). After approximately ten seconds, the line disappears. The experiment refreshes and a new result is published.
</p>
   <br />
  <p>
   An open browser will generate roughly 8,640 lines every day. (It is unknown whether or not lines will still be generated if no browser is open or if no user is watching). At some point, the story as Borges intended it will appear. In the decades or centuries between now and then, this translation will continue hybridizing the opposing versions and translations and running them through the natural language processor in an attempt to transform Borges’s story into literary double helix which can then be spliced, shuffled, and duplicated to produce ephemeral, grammatical mutations that, after hundreds of cycles, seem to offer a glimpse of Borgesian order. It is my elegant hope that someday it will reveal the Order.
