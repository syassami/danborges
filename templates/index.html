    *The above line is composed of words from Jorge Luis Borges’ “The Library of Babel” [“La Biblioteca de Babel”]; its format was inspired by the authorial, editorial, and translational variations of the text.
   </p> 
   <br />
   <p>
One of the most provocative variations concerns the possible contents of this “infinite” library. The text translated by Andrew Hurley in 1998 includes the following description:
  </p>
     <br />
   <p style="padding-left:3em">
    … [The library’s] bookshelves contain all the possible combinations of the twenty-two orthographic symbols … all that is able to be expressed, in every language. All — the detailed history of the future … the true story of your death, the translation of every book into every language, the interpolations of every book into all books, the treatise Bede could have written (but did not) on the mythology of the Saxon people, the lost books of Tacitus.
   </p> 
      <br />
   <p>
We suppose that Hurley’s translation was drawn from the story as published in <i>El Jardin de los Senderos Que se Bifurcan<i> (1941) which reads:
   </p> 
      <br />
   <p style="padding-left:3em">
    … sus anaqueles registran todas las posibles combinaciones de los veintitantos símbolos ortográficos … o sea todo lo que es dable expresar: en todos los idiomas. Todo: la historia minuciosa del porvenir, … la relación verídica de tu muerte, la versión de cada libro a todas las lenguas, las interpolaciones de cada libro en todos los libros, el tratado que Beda pudo escribir (y no escribió) sobre la mitología de los sajones, los libros perdidos de Tácito.
   </p>
      <br />
   <p>
 Yet in Anthony Kerrigan’s translation of “The Library of Babel” published in 1962 by Grove Press, the final two phrases have been cut. Kerrigan writes of the library’s contents: 
  </p>
     <br />
   <p style="padding-left:3em">
  Everything is there: the minute history of the future, … the veridical account of your death, a version of each book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.
   </p>
      <br />
   <p>
Kerrigan’s translation corresponds with the 1956 Emece edition of <i>Ficciones<i>, which also concludes with the sweeping proclamation that the library contains “las interpolaciones de cada libro en todos los libros.” 
  </p>
     <br />
   <p style="padding-left:3em">
Todo: la historia minuciosa del porvenir, … la relación verídica de tu muerte, la versión de cada libro a todas las lenguas, las interpolaciones de cada libro en todos los libros.
  </p>
      <br />
   <p>
  Borges likely omitted the concluding phrases concerning Bede and Tacitus between the first publication of 1941 and 1944, when “La Biblioteca de Babel” was republished with nine other stories (“Artificios”) by Editorial Sur under the title <i>Ficciones<i>. The initial version gestures towards Bede’s immeasurable contribution to the history of letters and the lamentable loss of Tacitus’ manuscripts, but the condensed line is stylistically and philosophically superior. After explaining that the library contains “everything...a version of each book in all languages” mentioning books Bede could have written (but did not) and Tacitus’ lost books is unnecessary, even tautological. If the library is total, all books are books that Bede could have written (but did not), and no book could be one of the “lost” books of Tacitus if no specific book can found. Like superfluous lines of code, the passage loses no meaning and becomes more graceful after the phrases are erased. 
 </p>
    <br />
  <p>
   However, the problematic search for definitive editions and accurate translations of this story reflects the enigma of Borges's Library, in which the variation of even a single letter (on any line or page) summons Cantorian infinities of stacks, hundreds of miles of books varying by one letter that may be stored light-years from the “original.” 
 </p>
    <br />
  <p>
Ever conscious of this enigma, Borges, a multilingual scholar and translator, implied that “faithful” translations might have less to do with faith or knowledge and more to do with luck, evocatively asking: 
 </p>
    <br />
   <p style="padding-left:3em">
  “Is translation more than the long experimental lottery of omissions and emphases?”
 </p>
    <br />
 <p>
The “long experimental lottery” of this infinitive translation (a play on the desire for definitive translations) uses a natural language processing code to randomly select a word from one of the two editions published by Borges (in 1941 and 1944) and from one of the two English translations (by Hurley and Kerrigan) and then applies 2-gram modelling from the Python Natural Language Tool Kit to generate a line of sixteen words or approximately 80 characters (like the lines in every book in the Library of Babel). After approximately ten seconds, the line disappears. The experiment refreshes, a new result is published. 
</p>
   <br />
  <p>
An open browser will generate roughly 8,640 lines every day. At some point, the story as Borges intended it will appear. In the decades or centuries between now and then, this translation will continue hybridizing the opposing versions and translations and running them through the natural language processor in an attempt to transform Borges’s text into a literary double helix which can then be spliced, shuffled, and duplicated to produce ephemeral, grammatical mutations that offer a glimpse of the library's order. It is my elegant hope that someday, the page will reveal the Order.
